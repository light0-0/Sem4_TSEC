# DBMS
SO in The DBMS Folder you will find the Experiment list and the code+output of each experiment.
Make sure to check first the Experiment list while copying any file because it might be change in the syllabus.
Don't just copy the code try to understand the SQL language and Database it is very easy.
All the Experiments are Connected to Each other so just don't take randomly any experiment and put it in the file.

NOTE:::-- About experiment no. 11. Probably in lab you will create your database in ORACLE software but exp_11 does not implement in Oracle. it does but you have to change the environment variables and a whole lot of complex procedure. SO here's the solution Just download xxam or wamp server. Create a User give User all privelages. and thenn create a DataBase. Create First Table that i have put in 3_Create_Table file . Then copy code in 11_EXP paste it in idle or any other python enviornment platform and run the code . You will se a GUI in which you can insert or update data . which will store in your database in local server


# MICROPROCCESSOR 

Just check from the EXP_LIST the name of the experiment you want dont just take blindly.
Check the questions of the Assignments that you have got then take the assignment file.
You dont need to worry about assembly language so much because till date collage does not conduct practicals in MP just take knowledge what Microproccessors are

# Operating System

Missing codes are very easy you can learn in lab Itself and again check from #_EXP_List before reffering any code

#Analysis of Algorithm

its a very fun and one of the most important subject.
Preapare it by hard and try to practise AOA Codes in lab also.
